What do we do with disagreements:
- first the two people will talk it out and try to come to an understanding. 
- If not then we’ll bring in the rest of the group to discuss. 
- Then if no agreement is reached we’ll vote. Finally in the event of a tie, we will call in Tom or Cassio to help us decide the best path moving forward

Frustration and how to deal with it:
- Express early and empathetically 
- Take care of yourself and do what you need to calm down (take walk/break/eat/drink)
- Don’t take things personally, we’re all working together

How are we going to merge:
- open communication about what we’re doing and merge often
- Have another person sign off on the merge and review the code
- Never push to master -> protected branch

Testing:
- try and write tests for our main or important components

Asking for help:
- give yourself 15 alone -> ask teammate/team - 20-30 mins -> TA or teacher

Pairing:
- Pairs cannot set their own norms!
- For 2 people pairing, play it by ear whether they should get their own room.

After-hours:
- Communicate so 2 people do not work on the same thing
- Start out having it voluntary
- No pressure, no judgement (if you gotta go, you gotta go)

Stand-up meetings:
- 15 minutes every morning
- Probably other meeting throughout the day
